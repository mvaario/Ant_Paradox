Ant on the rubber rope paradox

------------------------------

Project intent to demonstrate ant on the rubber rope paradox

------------------------------

If ant is going 1 m/s on the rubber rope that is extending more than the ant's speed 1 m/s
- can it never get to the other side?
What if the rubber rope extending speed is accelerating?

------------------------------

mainv2.py

User can change parameters
- ant starting position
- length of the rope
- ant's moving speed (m/s)
- rope extending speed (m/s)
- rope acceleration (m/s^2)

- added accurate (10^acc / sec)
- added calculations

Code will show to user time and ant's process when code is running

After ant made on the other side of the rubber rope code stops
and prints final result
- time (min / sec)
- ant's final position (meters) 
- rubber rope length (meters)

- calculated results
