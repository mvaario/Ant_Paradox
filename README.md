Ant on the rubber rope paradox

------------------------------

Project intent to make to demonstrate ant on the rubber rope paradox

------------------------------

If ant is going 1 m/s on the rubber rope that is extending more than the ant's speed 1 m/s
- can it never get to the other side?
What if the rubber rope extending speed is accelerating?

------------------------------

Main.py

User can change parameters
- ant starting position
- length of the rope
- ant's moving speed (m/s)
- rope extending speed (m/s)
- rope acceleration (m/s^2)

Code will show to user time and ant's process when code is running
After ant made on the other side of the rubber rope code stops
and prints final result
- time (min / sec)
- ant's final position (meters) 
- rubber rope length (meters)
